# Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance Navigation for Magnetic Microrobot with Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the STTRL-DVO (Spatial-Temporal Transformer-based Reinforcement Learning with Deterministic VO) framework, designed to train and deploy a mobile magnetic microrobot for navigation tasks in complex environments. The robot is trained to navigate toward a dynamic goal while effectively avoiding obstacles, making it suitable for challenging scenarios.

## Key Features
* **Transformer-based Reinforcement Learning**: Utilizes advanced transformer architectures to process spatial and temporal data for effective decision-making.
* **Dynamic Goal Navigation**: Capable of adapting to a moving target.
* **Simulation and Real-world Testing**: Supports training and evaluation both in simulation and on physical robots.

## Demonstrations
Here are two demos showing our control policy for navigating in the simulation and real world.
